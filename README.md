Submission includes:
1- Readme
2- Poster
3- Matlab Code and Data for final file
4- Supporting Document.
5- Python File including all the EDA part.


Matlab Code
**************

1. training_and_testing.m - It consists of the code where data is split into testing and training. This file should run first.

2. MachineLearning_DT_vs_NB_before.m - This incudes baseline models of Naive bayes and Decision tree.

3. MachineLearning_DT_vs_NB_after.m - This includes optimized models of Niave bayes and Decision tree including all hyperparameters.

CSV files
************

1. wind_data.csv - original dataset

2. trainingdata.csv - It contains training data which we split using training_and_testing.m script.

3. testingdata.csv - It contains testing data which we split using training_and_testing.m script.

Python File
*************

This file contains explolatory data analysis done on the original dataset. It includes label encoding the target column, plotting and correlation.
